# Credit-Card-Fraud-Predictor
This Python project predicts fraudulent credit card transactions by using logistic regression.

Description:

This Python program utilizes a range of libraries, including pandas for data preprocessing and numpy for numerical computations, 
to analyze a dataset of credit card transactions from kaggle. It utilizes scikit-learn to build a model, specifically logistic 
regression, and to assess its performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision. The dataset is divided into 
training and testing sets using model_selection, and values are standardized. Visualizations, such as precision-recall curves 
and confusion matrices, are generated using matplotlib. This code overall accurately predicts fraudulent credit card transactions.
